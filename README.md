# RepresentApp

The Represent app allows the user to input their own zip code and find out congressional representatives and other electoral information for that area. It also can generate this information for a users current location, or can generate this information for a random location. 

Here's a link to a video demonstration of the app in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjnhXssjmRU
